### Algorithm Overview
This algorithm involves maintaining a working set of experts, updating their weights using a multiplicative update rule, and then pruning to keep the set size manageable. The steps are designed for efficiency, aiming to only keep $O(\log(T))$ experts at each time step.

### Step-by-Step Explanation with Equations

1. **Initialization:**
   - We start with an Online Convex Optimization (OCO) algorithm $A$ and initialize:
     $$
     p_1^1 = 1, \quad S_1 = \{1\}
     $$
   - Here, $p_1^1$ is the initial probability weight for the first expert, and $S_1$ is the set of experts we're tracking at time $t=1$.
   - For simplicity, our experts will just be enumerated as the time step $t \in T$, e.g. 1 in this case; in practice, this would be a PyTorch model class.

2. **Main Loop (for each time step $t$):**
   For each time step $t$ from $1$ to $T$:
   - **Compute outputs from all experts in the working set $S_t$:**
     For each expert $j \in S_t$, compute the output:
     $$
     x_j^t \leftarrow A(f_j, f_{j+1}, \ldots, f_{t-1})
     $$
     - In PyTorch, you can represent this as a loop over your set of experts $S_t$, where each expert's model receives the losses it has experienced so far as input to compute the new output.
  
   - **Aggregate the outputs to get the final decision:**
     Use a weighted sum to get the overall decision for the current step:
     $$
     x_t = \sum_{j \in S_t} p_j^t \cdot x_j^t
     $$
     - This step will involve summing the outputs of each expert, scaled by their current probability weights. In PyTorch, you can use `torch.sum()` on the weighted outputs.

   - **Update the probability weights using the loss $f_t$:**
     After receiving the loss $f_t$ for the aggregated decision $x_t$, perform a multiplicative update on each expert's probability weight:
     $$
     \hat{p}_i^{t+1} = \frac{p_i^t \cdot \exp(-\alpha f_t(x_i^t))}{\sum_{j \in S_t} p_j^t \cdot \exp(-\alpha f_t(x_j^t))}
     $$
     - This is a weighted softmax update to adjust the probability weights of each expert based on their performance. In PyTorch, you can implement this using `torch.exp()` and `torch.softmax()`.

3. **Pruning Step:**
   - Update the set of experts for the next round by pruning and adding the new expert:
     $$
     S_{t+1} \leftarrow \text{Prune}(S_t) \cup \{t + 1\}
     $$
   - Set the initial probability for the new expert:
     $$
     \hat{p}_{t+1}^{t+1} = \frac{1}{t}
     $$
   - Normalize the probability weights for all experts in the new set:
     $$
     p_i^{t+1} = \frac{\hat{p}_i^{t+1}}{\sum_{j \in S_{t+1}} \hat{p}_j^{t+1}}
     $$
   - Pruning ensures that only the most relevant experts remain active, reducing the overall size of the set $S_t$ to $O(\log(T))$.

### Detailed Pruning Procedure Explanation

The pruning procedure determines which experts to retain based on their "lifetime":

- **Lifetime Definition:** If an integer $i$ has the form $i = r \cdot 2^k$ (where $r$ is odd), then its lifetime is defined as:
  $$
  \text{lifetime}(i) = 2^{k+2} + 1
  $$
- An integer $i$ is "alive" at time $t$ if it satisfies:
  $$
  i \in [i, i + \text{lifetime}(i)]
  $$
- At each time step $t$, the set $S_t$ consists of all integers that are alive at that time.

### Verifying the Properties

- **Property 1:** For every position $s \leq t$, the interval $\left[s, \frac{s+t}{2}\right]$ must intersect with $S_t$. This ensures that the set of experts is spread out logarithmically. The largest power of $2$ in this range guarantees that some integer remains alive.

- **Property 2:** The size of $S_t$ is bounded by $O(\log(t))$. The integers of the form $r \cdot 2^k$ with odd $r$ ensure that only a small number of experts are alive, as they are separated by gaps proportional to $2^k$.

This ensures that the number of experts alive at any given time is manageable, and the implementation in PyTorch will stay efficient.

### Implementation Tips in PyTorch

- **Using Softmax:** For the multiplicative update, leveraging `torch.nn.functional.softmax()` will simplify the probability normalization step.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Use in-place operations (`tensor[i] += value`) when updating tensors to manage memory efficiently.
- **Efficient Pruning:** When handling pruning, use tensor slicing and masking techniques (`tensor[mask]`) to eliminate unnecessary computations.
